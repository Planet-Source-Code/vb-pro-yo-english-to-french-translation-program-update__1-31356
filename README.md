## English To French Translation Program\(UPDATE\!\)


</div>

### Description

This program translates as you type. Right now I am mainly working on english to french but I have put limited support for french to english. I know that there are lots of sites that can do this for you but I made this so if someone was making a chat program people speaking two different languages could talk to each other. Please leave a comment so I know where to improve. I will try to upload a new version in a few days or so.
